    oil: {
      intro: 'Brent crude is the price benchmark for roughly two thirds of the world\'s internationally traded oil. The figure below is quoted in US dollars per barrel and refreshed on a daily schedule.',
      sections: [
        { h: 'What is Brent crude oil?', p: 'Brent is a light, sweet crude blend produced from oil fields in the North Sea between the United Kingdom and Norway. Because it is low in sulphur and relatively easy to refine, it became the reference grade against which most internationally traded crude is priced. When news reports say "the oil price", they are usually quoting Brent.' },
        { h: 'Why Brent is the global benchmark', p: 'Unlike landlocked grades, Brent can be loaded onto tankers directly at sea, which makes it easy to trade and ship anywhere. That physical flexibility, combined with a deep futures market on the ICE exchange, turned it into the pricing anchor for crude sold from Europe, Africa and the Middle East to Asia.' },
        { h: 'How the price is quoted', p: 'Brent is quoted in US dollars per barrel, and one barrel equals 42 US gallons or about 159 litres. To convert to a per-litre figure, divide the barrel price by 159. The US dollar quotation means that a stronger dollar tends to make oil more expensive for buyers using other currencies, even when the underlying price has not moved.' },
        { h: 'What moves the price', p: 'Supply decisions by OPEC and other major producers, geopolitical events in producing regions, changes in global demand, refinery maintenance seasons and currency swings in the US dollar all influence the quote. Because oil is priced in dollars, currency moves alone can shift the figure.' },
      ],
      faq: [
        { q: 'How often is the Brent price updated?', a: 'Prices are collected on a daily schedule during trading hours and cached for fast delivery. Markets close at weekends, so the most recent trading day figure is shown until trading resumes.' },
        { q: 'Is this the official settlement price?', a: 'No. The figure is a market reference price from public data providers, not an official exchange settlement. It is suitable for tracking general trends, not for settlement or trading.' },
        { q: 'Why does the price not change at weekends?', a: 'Global oil markets close for the weekend. Any figure shown over Saturday and Sunday is the last price from the previous trading session.' },

    },
    gold: {
      intro: 'Gold is quoted internationally in US dollars per troy ounce. The gram figure is derived from that quote, so both move together.',
      sections: [
        { h: 'What is the international gold price?', p: 'The international spot price, often written as XAU/USD, is the price of one troy ounce of pure gold in US dollars. It is set by continuous trading across major dealing centres and is the reference used by bullion dealers, jewellers and financial institutions worldwide.' },
        { h: 'Troy ounces and grams', p: 'Precious metals use the troy ounce, which is about 31.1035 grams — slightly heavier than an ordinary ounce of 28.35 grams. To convert a gram price into a troy ounce price, multiply by 31.1035. Most retail jewellery is sold by the gram, so the gram figure is usually the more practical one for personal purchases.' },
        { h: 'Purity and fineness', p: 'The spot price refers to pure 24-carat gold. Lower-carat items contain less gold: 18-carat is 75% gold, 14-carat about 58.5%. To estimate the gold value of an item, multiply its weight by its fineness and then by the current price.' },
        { h: 'What moves the price', p: 'Gold responds to real interest rates, inflation expectations, the strength of the US dollar, central bank purchasing and demand for safe-haven assets during periods of uncertainty. Because it is quoted in dollars, it often moves inversely to the dollar.' },
      ],
      faq: [
        { q: 'How often is the gold price updated?', a: 'Continuously. While the market is open, the figure on this page updates in real time in your browser straight from the spot market, with several independent providers standing behind it. A server-side copy captured every three minutes supplies the first paint and acts as a fallback.' },
        { q: 'Why is the gram price different from what my jeweller quotes?', a: 'Retail prices include making charges, design costs, taxes and a dealer margin on top of the metal value. This page shows the raw metal reference price only.' },
        { q: 'Is this the price I would get if I sold gold?', a: 'Not necessarily. Dealers buy back below the spot price and may apply assay or handling fees. Treat the figure here as a benchmark for comparison.' },

      intro: 'China publishes maximum retail fuel prices per province. The figures below are guidance ceilings in yuan per litre, revised periodically by the national pricing authority.',
      sections: [
        { h: 'How China sets fuel prices', p: 'Retail fuel prices in mainland China follow a managed pricing mechanism. The national authority adjusts the ceiling price when the moving average of international crude prices moves beyond a set threshold, and adjustments are reviewed on a cycle of roughly ten working days. When international crude moves very sharply, the mechanism also dampens the pass-through to protect consumers and industry.' },
        { h: 'Why prices differ by province', p: 'The national guidance sets a baseline, but each province publishes its own ceiling. Transport distance from refineries and ports, local distribution costs, regional taxes and market conditions all create variation. This is why inland provinces are often slightly more expensive than coastal ones.' },
        { h: 'What the grades mean', p: 'The numbers 92, 95 and 98 refer to the research octane number, a measure of resistance to engine knocking. Higher numbers suit engines with higher compression ratios. Choosing a grade above what your engine requires does not usually improve performance, so the manufacturer recommendation in your handbook is the right guide.' },
        { h: 'Diesel and seasonal grades', p: 'Zero-grade diesel is the standard automotive diesel grade. In colder northern regions, seasonal variants with lower cloud points are supplied in winter to prevent waxing in the fuel system.' },
      ],
      faq: [
        { q: 'Are these the exact prices at the pump?', a: 'They are provincial maximum retail guidance prices. Individual stations may offer discounts or adjustments, so the price you actually pay can be slightly lower.' },
        { q: 'How often does the price change?', a: 'The guidance is reviewed roughly every ten working days, or sooner when international crude moves sharply. This page refreshes on a daily schedule.' },
        { q: 'Why is my city different from the provincial figure?', a: 'Some provinces publish a single provincial ceiling while others differentiate by city or region. Check the entry closest to your location.' },
      ],
    },
    fx: {
      intro: 'The converter below uses reference exchange rates that are refreshed on a daily schedule. It is designed for quick estimates rather than exact settlement.',
      sections: [
        { h: 'What is a reference exchange rate?', p: 'A mid-market or reference rate sits roughly halfway between the buy and sell prices that banks quote each other. It is the fairest single number to describe what a currency is worth at a point in time, and it is what most public rate tables display.' },
        { h: 'Why your bank gives a different number', p: 'Retail and commercial banks add a margin on top of the mid-market rate, and card networks add their own spread and fees. That is why the rate you receive in practice is usually a little worse than the reference rate shown here.' },
        { h: 'How to read a currency pair', p: 'In a pair such as USD/CNY, the first currency is the base and the second is the quote. The number tells you how much of the quote currency one unit of the base currency buys. If the number rises, the base currency has strengthened against the quote currency.' },
        { h: 'What moves exchange rates', p: 'Interest rate differentials between countries, inflation outlook, trade balances, capital flows, political stability and central bank policy all influence rates. Currency markets are open around the clock on weekdays but close at weekends, which is why rates appear frozen from Friday evening to Sunday.' },
      ],
      faq: [
        { q: 'How current are these rates?', a: 'Rates are refreshed on a daily schedule. They are suitable for budgeting and comparison, but not for executing a transfer.' },
        { q: 'Is this the rate my bank will give me?', a: 'No. Banks and money transfer services apply a margin and fees on top of the reference rate. Expect the practical rate to differ.' },
        { q: 'Can I use this for accounting or settlement?', a: 'No. Use the official rate published by your bank, payment provider or tax authority for any financial record.' },
      ],
    },
    wti: {
      intro: 'WTI is the benchmark crude for the United States and the second most quoted oil price in the world after Brent. It is quoted in US dollars per barrel and refreshed while US markets are trading.',
      sections: [
        { h: 'What is WTI crude oil?', p: 'West Texas Intermediate is a light, sweet crude grade produced primarily in the US Permian Basin and the mid-continent. It is very light and very low in sulphur — arguably the highest quality of the major benchmarks — which makes it especially attractive to refineries configured for gasoline production. Despite the name, it is no longer produced only in Texas; the grade now describes a specification rather than a single geographic source.' },
        { h: 'Why WTI is delivered at Cushing', p: 'The WTI futures contract settles at Cushing, Oklahoma — an inland hub where dozens of pipelines converge and hundreds of storage tanks sit. That concentration of infrastructure makes it the natural pricing point for US inland crude. But it is also WTI\'s structural weakness: oil sitting in Cushing must leave by pipeline, and when those pipelines are full the local price can fall out of step with the seaborne international market.' },
        { h: 'WTI and Brent: why two benchmarks', p: 'Both are light sweet crudes, so over long periods their prices move together. The gap between them is not a mistake — it reflects real differences in logistics. Brent can be loaded directly onto tankers in the North Sea and shipped anywhere, so it tracks the global seaborne market. WTI is priced inland in the American mid-continent, so it responds more sharply to US pipeline capacity, Cushing inventory levels and domestic shale output.' },
        { h: 'What the Brent–WTI spread tells you', p: 'The difference between the two prices is one of the most watched numbers in energy. When Brent trades well above WTI, it usually means US crude is trapped inland by pipeline constraints or a supply glut. When the gap narrows, it often signals that export capacity has expanded or that global supply has tightened. Reading the two together gives a far clearer picture of the oil market than either price alone.' },
      ],
      faq: [
        { q: 'Is WTI the oil price US drivers pay?', a: 'It is the main reference for US crude, but pump prices also depend on refining costs, distribution, taxes and regional supply. WTI tells you what the raw crude costs, not what the finished fuel costs.' },
        { q: 'Why is WTI usually cheaper than Brent?', a: 'It often is, but not always. WTI is priced at an inland hub rather than a seaport, so it is more sensitive to US pipeline bottlenecks and domestic inventory. A wide gap generally reflects a logistics constraint rather than a difference in oil quality.' },
        { q: 'How often is the WTI price updated?', a: 'The figure is collected while markets are trading and cached for fast delivery. Markets close at weekends, so the most recent trading day level is shown until trading resumes.' },

      sections: [
        { h: 'Qu\'est-ce que le brut Brent ?', p: 'Le Brent est un mélange de pétrole brut léger et à faible teneur en soufre issu de gisements de la mer du Nord, entre le Royaume-Uni et la Norvège. Sa faible teneur en soufre et sa relative facilité de raffinage en ont fait la qualité de référence pour la fixation du prix de la plupart du pétrole échangé internationalement. Lorsque les médias évoquent « le prix du pétrole », ils citent généralement le Brent.' },
        { h: 'Pourquoi le Brent est-il la référence mondiale', p: 'Contrairement aux qualités enclavées, le Brent peut être chargé directement sur des pétroliers en mer, ce qui facilite son commerce et son expédition partout dans le monde. Cette souplesse logistique, associée à un marché à terme profond sur la bourse ICE, en a fait l\'ancre de prix du pétrole vendu de l\'Europe, de l\'Afrique et du Moyen-Orient vers l\'Asie.' },
        { h: 'Comment le prix est-il coté', p: 'Le Brent est coté en dollars par baril, un baril valant 42 gallons américains, soit environ 159 litres. Pour obtenir le prix au litre, divisez le prix du baril par 159. La cotation en dollars signifie qu\'un dollar plus fort renchérit le pétrole pour les acheteurs d\'autres devises, même si le prix sous-jacent n\'a pas bougé.' },
        { h: 'Ce qui fait bouger le prix', p: 'Les décisions de production de l\'OPEP et des autres grands producteurs, les événements géopolitiques dans les régions productrices, l\'évolution de la demande mondiale, les saisons de maintenance des raffineries et les fluctuations du dollar influencent la cotation. Le pétrole étant libellé en dollars, le seul mouvement des devises peut modifier le chiffre.' },

Il se forme par des échanges continus entre les grandes places de cotation et constitue la référence utilisée par les négociants en lingots, les bijoutiers et les institutions financières du monde entier.' },

Pour convertir un prix au gramme en prix à l\'once troy, multipliez par 31,1035. La plupart des bijoux vendus au détail le sont au gramme : cette valeur est donc la plus pratique pour un achat personnel.' },

Les articles de titre inférieur contiennent moins d\'or : 18 carats représentent 75% et 14 carats environ 58,5%. Pour estimer la valeur en or d\'un objet, multipliez son poids par son titre puis par le prix actuel.' },

        { h: 'Comment la Chine fixe les prix des carburants', p: 'Les prix de détail des carburants en Chine continentale suivent un mécanisme de prix administré. L\'autorité nationale ajuste le prix plafond lorsque la moyenne mobile des cours internationaux du brut dépasse un seuil défini, et les ajustements sont examinés selon un cycle d\'environ dix jours ouvrés.

La distance de transport depuis les raffineries et les ports, les coûts locaux de distribution, les taxes régionales et les conditions de marché créent des écarts. C\'est pourquoi les provinces de l\'intérieur sont souvent légèrement plus chères que les provinces côtières.' },

      sections: [
        { h: "Qu'est-ce que le brut WTI ?", p: "Le West Texas Intermediate est un brut léger et doux produit principalement dans le bassin permien et la région du centre du continent américain. Il est très léger et très pauvre en soufre — sans doute la meilleure qualité parmi les grandes références —, ce qui le rend particulièrement attractif pour les raffineries orientées vers l'essence. Malgré son nom, il n'est plus produit uniquement au Texas : le grade décrit aujourd'hui une spécification plutôt qu'une origine géographique unique." },
        { h: 'Pourquoi la livraison se fait à Cushing', p: "Le contrat à terme du WTI se dénoue à Cushing, en Oklahoma, un nœud intérieur où convergent des dizaines d'oléoducs et où s'alignent des centaines de réservoirs. Cette concentration d'infrastructures en fait le point de cotation naturel du brut de l'intérieur des États-Unis. Mais c'est aussi sa faiblesse structurelle : le pétrole stocké à Cushing ne peut partir que par oléoduc, et lorsque ces conduits sont saturés, le prix local se désynchronise du marché maritime international." },
        { h: 'WTI et Brent : pourquoi deux références', p: "Les deux sont des bruts légers et doux : à long terme, leurs prix évoluent ensemble. L'écart entre eux n'est pas une erreur, il reflète des différences logistiques bien réelles. Le Brent peut être chargé directement sur des navires en mer du Nord et expédié n'importe où : il suit donc le marché maritime mondial. Le WTI est coté à l'intérieur des terres, au centre du continent américain, et réagit plus vivement à la capacité des oléoducs, au niveau des stocks de Cushing et à la production nationale de schiste." },
        { h: "Ce que l'écart Brent-WTI vous apprend", p: "La différence entre les deux prix est l'un des chiffres les plus surveillés du secteur énergétique. Quand le Brent se négocie nettement au-dessus du WTI, cela signifie généralement que le brut américain est bloqué à l'intérieur des terres par des contraintes d'oléoducs ou un excédent d'offre. Quand l'écart se resserre, cela indique souvent que la capacité d'exportation s'est développée ou que l'offre mondiale s'est tendue. Lire les deux prix ensemble donne une image bien plus claire du marché que chacun pris isolément." },

      faq: [
        { q: "Est-ce le prix que paient les automobilistes américains ?", a: "C'est la référence principale du brut aux États-Unis, mais le prix à la pompe dépend aussi des coûts de raffinage, de la distribution, des taxes et de l'offre régionale. Le WTI indique le prix du brut lui-même, pas celui du carburant fini." },
        { q: 'Pourquoi le WTI est-il souvent moins cher que le Brent ?', a: "Souvent, mais pas toujours. Le WTI est coté à un nœud intérieur et non dans un port, ce qui le rend plus sensible aux goulets d'étranglement des oléoducs et aux stocks nationaux. Un écart important reflète généralement une contrainte logistique, non une différence de qualité." },

        { h: 'Was ist Brent-Rohöl?', p: 'Brent ist eine leichte, schwefelarme Rohölmischung aus Ölfeldern in der Nordsee zwischen dem Vereinigten Königreich und Norwegen. Wegen ihres geringen Schwefelgehalts und der vergleichsweise einfachen Raffination wurde sie zur Referenzsorte, an der sich der größte Teil des international gehandelten Rohöls orientiert. Wenn in den Nachrichten vom „Ölpreis" die Rede ist, ist meist Brent gemeint.' },
        { h: 'Warum Brent die globale Referenz ist', p: 'Anders als Binnensorten kann Brent direkt auf See auf Tanker verladen werden, was Handel und Verschiffung an jeden Ort erleichtert. Diese logistische Flexibilität hat es zusammen mit einem tiefen Terminmarkt an der Börse ICE zum Preisananker für Rohöl gemacht, das von Europa, Afrika und dem Nahen Osten nach Asien verkauft wird.' },

Für den Preis pro Liter teilt man den Barrelpreis durch 159. Die Notierung in Dollar bedeutet, dass ein stärkerer Dollar Öl für Käufer anderer Währungen verteuert, selbst wenn sich der eigentliche Preis nicht bewegt hat.' },

        { h: 'Was ist WTI-Rohöl?', p: 'West Texas Intermediate ist ein leichtes, süßes Rohöl, das vor allem im Perm-Becken und in der Mittelkontinentalregion der USA gefördert wird. Es ist sehr leicht und sehr schwefelarm — qualitativ wohl die hochwertigste der großen Referenzsorten — und damit besonders attraktiv für Raffinerien, die auf Benzin ausgelegt sind. Trotz des Namens stammt es längst nicht mehr nur aus Texas: Die Bezeichnung beschreibt heute eine Spezifikation, nicht eine einzelne geografische Quelle.' },
        { h: 'Warum Cushing der Lieferort ist', p: 'Der WTI-Terminkontrakt wird in Cushing, Oklahoma, erfüllt — einem Binnenknotenpunkt, an dem Dutzende Pipelines zusammenlaufen und mehrere hundert Lagertanks stehen. Diese Konzentration an Infrastruktur macht den Ort zum natürlichen Preispunkt für US-Binnenrohöl. Sie ist aber auch WTIs strukturelle Schwäche: Öl, das in Cushing liegt, kann nur per Pipeline abfließen, und wenn diese Pipelines voll sind, läuft der lokale Preis aus dem Takt mit dem internationalen Seemarkt.' },
        { h: 'WTI und Brent: Warum zwei Referenzen', p: 'Beide sind leichte Süßrohöle, sodass sich ihre Preise auf lange Sicht gemeinsam bewegen. Der Abstand zwischen ihnen ist kein Fehler, sondern spiegelt reale logistische Unterschiede. Brent lässt sich in der Nordsee direkt auf Tanker laden und weltweit verschiffen und folgt deshalb dem globalen Seemarkt. WTI wird im Binnenland, im amerikanischen Mittelkontinent, bepreist und reagiert stärker auf US-Pipelinekapazität, Lagerbestände in Cushing und die heimische Schieferölproduktion.' },
        { h: 'Was der Brent-WTI-Spread verrät', p: 'Die Differenz zwischen beiden Preisen ist eine der meistbeachteten Zahlen im Energiesektor. Notiert Brent deutlich über WTI, bedeutet das meist, dass US-Rohöl durch Pipelineengpässe oder ein Überangebot im Binnenland feststeckt. Verengt sich der Abstand, signalisiert das häufig ausgeweitete Exportkapazität oder einen strafferen globalen Markt. Beide Preise zusammen zu lesen ergibt ein deutlich klareres Bild als jeder für sich.' },

      faq: [
        { q: 'Ist WTI der Preis, den US-Autofahrer zahlen?', a: 'Es ist die wichtigste Referenz für US-Rohöl, doch der Preis an der Zapfsäule hängt zusätzlich an Raffineriekosten, Vertrieb, Steuern und regionalem Angebot. WTI zeigt, was das Rohöl kostet, nicht den fertigen Kraftstoff.' },
        { q: 'Warum ist WTI meist günstiger als Brent?', a: 'Oft ist es das, aber nicht immer. WTI wird an einem Binnenknoten und nicht an einem Seehafen bepreist und reagiert daher stärker auf Pipelineengpässe und Inlandsbestände. Ein großer Abstand spiegelt meist eine Logistikbeschränkung, keinen Qualitätsunterschied.' },

      sections: [
        { h: 'O que é o petróleo Brent?', p: 'O Brent é uma mistura de petróleo bruto leve e com baixo teor de enxofre, extraída de campos no Mar do Norte, entre o Reino Unido e a Noruega. Por ser pouco sulfuroso e relativamente fácil de refinar, tornou-se o tipo de referência usado para precificar a maior parte do petróleo negociado internacionalmente. Quando a imprensa fala em «o preço do petróleo», costuma citar o Brent.' },
        { h: 'Por que o Brent é a referência global', p: 'Ao contrário dos tipos situados no interior, o Brent pode ser carregado diretamente em navios-tanque no mar, o que facilita negociá-lo e enviá-lo a qualquer lugar. Essa flexibilidade logística, somada a um profundo mercado futuro na bolsa ICE, tornou-o a âncora de preços do petróleo vendido da Europa, África e Oriente Médio para a Ásia.' },
        { h: 'Como o preço é cotado', p: 'O Brent é cotado em dólares por barril; um barril equivale a 42 galões americanos, cerca de 159 litros. Para obter o preço por litro, divida o preço do barril por 159. A cotação em dólares significa que um dólar mais forte encarece o petróleo para compradores de outras moedas, mesmo que o preço subjacente não tenha mudado.' },
        { h: 'O que move o preço', p: 'Decisões de produção da OPEP e de outros grandes produtores, eventos geopolíticos nas regiões produtoras, mudanças na demanda global, temporadas de manutenção de refinarias e oscilações do dólar influenciam a cotação. Como o petróleo é precificado em dólares, o movimento cambial por si só pode alterar o número.' },

        { h: 'O que é o preço internacional do ouro?', p: 'O preço internacional à vista, frequentemente escrito XAU/USD, é o preço de uma onça troy de ouro puro em dólares americanos. Forma-se pela negociação contínua nos principais centros e é a referência usada por negociantes de barras, joalheiros e instituições financeiras no mundo todo.' },

Para converter um preço por grama em preço por onça troy, multiplique por 31,1035. A maior parte das joias no varejo é vendida por grama, de modo que esse costuma ser o valor mais prático para compras pessoais.' },

      sections: [
        { h: 'Como a China define os preços dos combustíveis', p: 'Os preços de varejo de combustíveis na China continental seguem um mecanismo de preços administrado. A autoridade nacional ajusta o teto quando a média móvel dos preços internacionais do petróleo ultrapassa um limite definido, e os ajustes são revisados em um ciclo de cerca de dez dias úteis. Quando o petróleo internacional oscila de forma muito brusca, o mecanismo também amortece a transferência para proteger consumidores e a indústria.' },
        { h: 'Por que os preços diferem por província', p: 'A orientação nacional estabelece uma base, mas cada província publica seu próprio teto. A distância de transporte desde refinarias e portos, custos locais de distribuição, tributos regionais e condições de mercado geram variação. Por isso, províncias do interior costumam ser um pouco mais caras que as costeiras.' },

Números maiores convêm a motores com taxa de compressão mais alta. Escolher um grau acima do que seu motor exige normalmente não melhora o desempenho; portanto, a recomendação do fabricante no manual é o guia correto.' },

      sections: [
        { h: 'O que é uma taxa de câmbio de referência?', p: 'Uma taxa média ou de referência fica aproximadamente no meio entre os preços de compra e venda que os bancos se cotam entre si. É o número único mais justo para descrever quanto vale uma moeda em determinado momento, e é o que a maioria das tabelas públicas exibe.' },
        { h: 'Por que seu banco informa um valor diferente', p: 'Bancos de varejo e comerciais acrescentam uma margem sobre a taxa média, e as redes de cartões somam seu próprio spread e tarifas. Por isso, a taxa que você recebe na prática costuma ser um pouco pior que a de referência exibida aqui.' },
        { h: 'Como ler um par de moedas', p: 'Em um par como USD/CNY, a primeira moeda é a base e a segunda é a cotada. O número indica quanta moeda cotada uma unidade da moeda base compra. Se o número sobe, a moeda base se fortaleceu frente à moeda cotada.' },

      sections: [
        { h: 'O que é o petróleo WTI?', p: 'O West Texas Intermediate é um petróleo leve e doce produzido principalmente na Bacia do Permiano e na região centro-continental dos Estados Unidos. É muito leve e com teor de enxofre muito baixo — provavelmente a mais alta qualidade entre as grandes referências —, o que o torna especialmente atraente para refinarias voltadas à produção de gasolina. Apesar do nome, já não é extraído apenas no Texas: hoje o grau descreve uma especificação, e não uma única origem geográfica.' },
        { h: 'Por que a entrega ocorre em Cushing', p: 'O contrato futuro do WTI é liquidado em Cushing, Oklahoma, um nó interior onde convergem dezenas de oleodutos e se erguem centenas de tanques de armazenagem. Essa concentração de infraestrutura faz do local o ponto natural de precificação do petróleo do interior americano. Mas é também a fraqueza estrutural do WTI: o óleo armazenado em Cushing só pode sair por oleoduto e, quando esses dutos estão cheios, o preço local se desalinha do mercado marítimo internacional.' },
        { h: 'WTI e Brent: por que existem duas referências', p: 'Ambos são petróleos leves e doces, de modo que, no longo prazo, seus preços se movem juntos. A diferença entre eles não é um erro: reflete diferenças logísticas reais. O Brent pode ser carregado diretamente em navios no Mar do Norte e enviado a qualquer lugar, acompanhando o mercado marítimo global. O WTI é cotado no interior, no centro do continente americano, e reage com mais intensidade à capacidade dos oleodutos, ao nível dos estoques em Cushing e à produção doméstica de xisto.' },
        { h: 'O que o diferencial Brent-WTI revela', p: 'A diferença entre os dois preços é um dos números mais observados do setor de energia. Quando o Brent é negociado bem acima do WTI, isso normalmente significa que o petróleo americano está preso no interior por restrições de oleodutos ou por excesso de oferta. Quando a diferença se estreita, costuma indicar que a capacidade de exportação se expandiu ou que a oferta global ficou mais apertada. Ler os dois preços em conjunto dá um quadro bem mais claro do mercado do que qualquer um isoladamente.' },

O WTI indica quanto custa o petróleo bruto, não o combustível pronto.' },
        { q: 'Por que o WTI costuma ser mais barato que o Brent?', a: 'Com frequência é, mas nem sempre. O WTI é cotado em um nó interior, não em um porto, o que o torna mais sensível a gargalos de oleodutos e aos estoques domésticos. Uma diferença ampla geralmente reflete uma restrição logística, não uma diferença de qualidade.' },
